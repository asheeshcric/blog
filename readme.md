## About
This blog is built using jekyll and powered by Github Pages.

## Setup & usage
Fork this repository and enable github pages from the repo settings. Customize the theme and you are ready to go.

### Options
For customization, you can navigate to `_config.yml` and change the variables as per your requirement.

### Colors
The basic colors are set into the ``base.scss`` file:
- $main-color: used for the menu, title, link and footer
- $background-color: used for background and links in the navigation menu
- $text-color: used for text and title in posts and pages 

To customize the colors, just set the values in HEX, RGB (or RGBa) or any other format accepted by CSS.

### Navigation menu
The links inside the navigation menu are autogenerated from pages having the layout set to ``page``.
You can set custom links, by putting in the ``<a>`` tag into the ``link.html`` file.

### Branch
- ``master``: is for deploying your blogs.

Last but not least: the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) is the best starting point!
