I earned my Bachelor's degree focused in Electronics & Communication Engineering from Kathmandu Engineering College. I worked as a Software Engineer for a couple of years. Currently, I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington (August 2019 - Present). I work in Heracleia Human-Centered Computing Lab at UTA under the supervision of Prof. Fillia Makedon. My major interests lie within computer vision and machine learning.

I believe in blending existence with innovation with vitality to impel striking results. It might be manipulating a medical x-ray image that enhances someone's well being or programming efficient robots to accomplish application-explicit tasks such as self-governing transportation, assisting medical surgery; these domains excite me as a person.
